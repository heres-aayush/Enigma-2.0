# Enigma 2.0

Enigma 2.0 is a revolutionary solution crafted to secure your most sensitive information. By seamlessly automating the process of detecting and redacting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from documents and communications, Enigma 2.0 leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) models to understand context and accurately pinpoint various types of PII. This ensures that your data remains protected, compliant, and secure.

### Encryption Techniques

#### AES Algorithm
- **Type**: Symmetric-key algorithm
- **Description**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely-used encryption standard that relies on a single key for both encryption and decryption. This makes it efficient for encrypting large amounts of data quickly.

#### RSA Cryptosystem
- **Type**: Asymmetric-key algorithm
- **Description**: RSA is a public-key cryptosystem that uses a pair of keys – one public and one private. The public key is used for encrypting data, and the private key is used for decrypting it. This makes RSA suitable for secure data transmission over unsecured networks.
